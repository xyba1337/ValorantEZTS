## Description
"Valorant Easy True Stretched" is a Python script that simplifies the process of achieving true stretched resolution in Valorant. Say goodbye to using annoying third-party programs like Winexp! With this script, you can disable WS_DLGFRAME and WS_BORDER and maximize the Valorant application window to achieve the desired effect.

## Features
- Disables WS_DLGFRAME and WS_BORDER
- Maximizes the Valorant application window

## Usage
1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository or download the script.
4. Run the script using Python: `python true_stretched.py`.
5. The script will apply the desired effect to the Valorant window.

Alternatively, you can download a ready-to-use executable file from the [Releases](https://github.com/xyba1337/ValorantEZTS/releases/tag/v1.0.0) section. Simply download the latest release and run the executable on your system.

1. Open your Valorant game
2. set display option on windowed and fill (no need to change your resolution in game)
3. after that go to desktop and change your system resolution on windows settings (find your own resolution on google with your preferred aspect ratio, example : "4:3 aspect ratio resolution")
4. apply your system resolution and run the executable file and your valorant will become Windowed Fullscreen and Stretched
